# E-catalogue Project
This is a simple project that creates an e-catalogue website using node JS and mongoDB Atlas. It does not have the full capabilities or features of an actual e-commerce website. This is a draft version of my project and there are some features that are not working yet. This is just to showcase some of my work and not an actual completed application.

## Built with
- Node JS
- MongoDB Atlas

## Getting started
1. Clone/download repository into your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command-line and go into the project directory that you have downloaded locally.
3. Run 'npm start' on your terminal/command-line.
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Usage
- In the home page, it shows the list of products that are in a mongoDB Atlas database.
- In the create page, you can create products that will appear in the home page.
- You may like or unlike products on the homepage. 
- The like button may have a short delay. 
- The 'Buy now' button does not have functionality to it and its mainly there for aesthetic purposes. 
- You may delete a product by going to http://localhost:3000/delete/:id , where you may include the product's id in the ':id' portion of the url. You may find the id of a product by right clicking on the page, clicking on 'inspect', and finding the id on the element's id attribute.

## Approach
- Vanilla javascript for frontend.
- Express framework for backend RESTful API
- Mongoose library to model application data
- MVC architecture to structuring application code
